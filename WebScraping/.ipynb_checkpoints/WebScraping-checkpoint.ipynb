      "['A psychological first-person horror from the Polish developer studio Bloober Team, known best for another horror game, entitled Layers of Fear. Observer is set in a cyberpunk universe, in Cracow of 2048. In the game you play as Daniel Lazarski (starred by Rutger Hauer, known from the film Blade Runner), a detective able to hack into people\\x92s minds. The game\\x92s story starts when the main hero gets a letter from his missing son, who turns out to be a high-ranking engineer working for a powerful corporation. The protagonist picks up an investigation that takes him to the slums of Cracow and forces him to relive dark memories and nightmares of both criminals and their victims. When it comes to gameplay, Observer is a first-person adventure game with survival horror mechanics. Most of the time the player explores grim locations and interacts with characters encountered on the way. An important aspect of gameplay are sequences in which the protagonist hacks into the minds of suspects and becomes part of their worst nightmares.', 'Another part of the Pro Evolution Soccer series of football simulators. Edition 2020 focuses more on multiplayer mode (especially for e-sport) and offers a lot of improvements in gameplay mechanics and graphics. Developers from the Japanese company Konami are responsible for creating this title.', 'A survival horror action adventure game. It is the debut project of the independent studio, Red Barrels, established by veterans of the gaming industry: David Chateauneuf, Philippe Morin, and Hugo Dallaire. Outlast\\x92s story is set in an old asylum for mentally ill, adapted, by the Murkoff corporation, into a research center. Journalist Miles Upshur gets his hands on information that strange things occur in that place. Looking for a sensation, he breaks into the asylum, hoping to discover a shocking truth about the experiments and profane rituals. We observe the game world from first-person perspective, and our only weapon is a camera with infrared lens. Gameplay focuses on exploring locations and avoiding direct confrontation with enemies. Due to a terrifying atmosphere and gore aesthetics, game is aimed exclusively at adults.', 'The third major installment in a life simulation game series, The Sims. The title was developed by The Sims Studio in cooperation with Maxis and Electronic Arts. As per usual, The Sims 3 lets you take control of a life of a virtual character from the cradle to the grave. Your job is to provide for the needs of your family of Sims when it comes to their social interactions, family matters, and career. The Sims 3 introduces two significant novelties to the game: lifetime wishes and a personality system that attributes 5 dominant character features to each Sim. As compared with previous installments in the franchise, the game\\x92s 3D visuals were significantly improved.', 'Another installment of the best-selling FPS series, and at the same time a direct continuation to Wolfenstein: The New Order created by Machine Games. The Action of Wolfenstein: The New Colossus is set in 1961 \\x96 after waking up from a coma B.J. Blazkowicz and his companions find the United States of America occupied by the Nazis. The main protagonist finds common ground with the leaders of the local resistance, and decides to help them fight the invaders. As in the previous Wolfenstein installment, the gameplay in The New Colossus features exploration, completing consecutive missions, and eliminating scores of diverse foes. The players are given a wide range of murderous weapons \\x96 including not only classic firearms but also some more elaborate pieces. Interestingly, once again the developers have decided to abandon health regeneration mechanics in favor of the old-school med-kit system. The game features high-quality 3D graphics \\x96 in comparison to its predecessor, the most significant are the texture and special effect enhancements that accompany the gunfights.', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty', '', 'empty']\n"
