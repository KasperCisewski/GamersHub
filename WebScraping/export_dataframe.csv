The game is set in Jadame - a fantasy world the players can associate with Might & Magic VIII. Six factions were included here and each of those has their own towns, different units and technologies. Each of them also has a dedicated school of magic and can hire characters belonging to one race only (Strongholds are the only exception). The mechanics went through many modifications and simplifications. The creators got rid of recruitment on a weekly basis, modified the combat system, and erased the necessity to have a character within an army - the characters were turned into units that participate directly in combat sequences. This however, brought many restrictions that made the experience both more difficult and entertaining. The game engine was significantly modified as well, which influenced the size of the maps and brought improvements to the visuals. For the first time in the series, the game is played from an isometric view.;https://cdn.gracza.pl/galeria/gry13/200/2092737937.jpg

The remastered edition is nearly identical to the original, and the changes it introduces involve mainly improved visuals. The title comes with all previously released DLCs and two new game modes: Survival and Spartan.;https://cdn.gracza.pl/i/h/10/419094049.jpg

There, we meet the protagonist, the Nameless One, an immortal man who will be trying to regain his identity and memories throughout the game. The title is powered by the game engine employed in a bestselling RPG, Baldurs Gate, and features similar gameplay mechanics. In the game, we control a party of very original characters and the gameplay focuses on performing subsequent quests connected to the past of the protagonist. The game heavily emphasizes the plot, while real-time combat, although present and featuring active pause mechanics, is of second importance.;https://cdn.gracza.pl/i/h/10/342858872.jpg

They are for example very effective when it comes to triggering explosives, but if needed they can also jump into a fire or down a cliff. Although the game is filled with unique humor and a bit tongue-in-cheek, it also contains a bar that represents the corruption level of the protagonist. The player can transform the protagonist into a true evil lord. However he can also change him into a lord protector, for example by helping the citizens of a besieged city. The title has nice looking, colorful graphics that use a slightly cartoonish style.;https://cdn.gracza.pl/galeria/gry13/200/75574546.jpg

The game offers fully 3D graphics with third-person perspective view and a real-time combat system that requires combining individual strikes into complex sequences.;https://cdn.gracza.pl/i/h/10/586595957.jpg

871;Duke Nukem Forever;Action;10 June 2011;Duke Nukem Forever is a sequel of the heavily-worshiped FPS, whose origins reach the beginning of the 1990s. After many years of silence, and a turbulent development cycle  during which the production was taken away from 3D Realms, and given to Gearbox Software  Duke Nukem Forever was released in a much more modern form. The premise of gameplay remains unchanged for the most part: gamers play as a muscled macho, who eliminates hordes of hog-like alien enemies in an spectacular manner, while saving lives of attractive females. The mechanics were enhanced with, for example, the ability to finish off enemies, drive vehicles, or use stationary weapons, environment destruction, and regenerating health (dubbed as ego) bar. The protagonist can use a slew of ridiculous guns, among which one can find the shrinker  a gun which shrinks enemies. Duke Nukem Forever is still a brutal shooter, full of raw humor, mostly expressed in the protagonists remarks, voiced by John St. John.;https://cdn.gracza.pl/galeria/gry13/200/172808125.jpg

The story told in the game is linear and the campaign is split into five chapters, each one consisting of several levels. The gameplay is based on fighting hordes of enemies  all sorts of creatures coming straight from hell as well as even more powerful bosses. Fortunately, the protagonist is far from being defenseless against those enemies  in combat he uses a vast arsenal of creative weapons, starting with classic shotguns and rocket launchers to the famous Stakegun or the so-called Shuriken-do Gun. Painkiller is characterized by high-quality graphics and realistic physics simulated by Havok 2.;https://cdn.gracza.pl/galeria/gry13/200/335166843.jpg

The little protagonist is able to climb, jump, and squeeze through holes between rocks, but in some cases he needs help from the griffin, who can remove larger obstacles or carry the boy into seemingly inaccessible places. The authors put much emphasis on the character's interactions with Trico and the creatures artificial intelligence, as he has his own individual character and reacts differently depending on the situation.;https://cdn.gracza.pl/i/h/10/495896929.jpg

Gameplay mechanics did not change and are the same as in the previous games of the series. Once again we can play stealthy and be a silent assassin or attack our enemies in plain sight.

883;Transport Fever;Strategy;08 November 2016;Transport Fever is an economic strategy by a Swiss studio, Urban Games. The previous game by this team was Train Fever, released in 2014. Contrary to that title, in Transport Fever the developers decided to offer not only land-based transport management, but aerial and marine transport as well.

In Transport Fever players need to design routes and railways, erect strategic buildings such as railway stations, airports, and docking bays. The network has to be maintained and upgraded to meet the increasing demands of the market. The whole transport empire is strictly dependent on the economy;
884;Hob;Arcade;26 September 2017;An arcade adventure game developed by Runic Games, an American studio behind the Torchlight series. In Hob, we assume the role of a hero who wakes up in a beautiful but dangerous world on the verge of annihilation. The protagonist does not remember how he came to be in that place, and he will learn the answers for his questions only as the story progresses. Whats interesting, the production does not feature any text or dialogues, which gives a lot of room for interpretation. The core of the platformer gameplay is exploration of the open world and interacting with both encountered creatures and the planet itself, including solving logic puzzles. The items we find and the protagonists skills that are discovered in the course of the game prove to be helpful in a dangerous and constantly changing environment. Thanks to them, we can reach previously inaccessible places. Hob features original cel-shading graphics.;https://cdn.gracza.pl/i/h/10/421343287.jpg

The games foundation is, again, the story campaign, which can be played either solo or in cooperation. An interesting feature of the game is that different characters often face different challenges (according to their skills), which allows the player to look at the events from different perspectives, and adds an element of competition. A multiplayer mode completes the game  here, like in the single, we can use a wide array of guns (from handguns, through sub-machine guns, to sniper rifles and rocket launchers).

In Silent Hunter 5 you are sent to the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, where, as the commander of a German U-boat VII, you hunt down the ships of the Allies.

One of the game's novelties is the fully interactive interior of the submarine. In this mode the controls system is similar to that of an FPS game. You can only do one things at a time, which means that you have to rely on your subordinates. Each of them has their own unique character, problems, and abilities.

In the game, we assume the role of a hero who belongs to one of three different classes, and our main task is to combat hordes of demons. During breaks between subsequent quests, we can go to the city, talk to non-player characters, and trade equipment. The gameplay is complemented by the possibility of acquiring and collecting cards that represent various skills of our character. The game features a curious visuals style thanks to which the game world looks as if its created from cut-outs.;https://cdn.gracza.pl/i/h/10/600258609.jpg

904;Pirates of the Caribbean;Action;01 July 2003;An action-adventure game with RPG features. It is based on Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Except for the title and the presence of some common motives (most of all the Black Pearl ship), the game has little in common with the movie.

The story is set in an African country devastated by a civil war, where the hero faces an army of robots and cyborgs belonging to Desperado Enforcement corporation.

Raidens main weapon is his electric katana  with it the hero destroys elements of environment and dismembers his enemies, thus ending their lives. Thanks to the Blade Mode he can also execute more precise cuts in slow-motion.;https://cdn.gracza.pl/i/h/10/957292656.jpg
