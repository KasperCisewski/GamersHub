71;AI War II;Strategy;22 October 2019;Developed by Arcen Games, AI War II is a science-fiction RTS game and a fully-fledged continuation of the studios 2009 debut project. AI War II picks up the story 355 years after the events from the previous installment. In the game, a player yet again takes command of the human army that during the past centuries has been preparing for war against the Artificial Intelligence faction. An enemy, who is much more powerful than expected, decides first to deal with other factions, which gives human operatives time to look for weaknesses in the AIs tactics and defenses. In terms of its gameplay, AI War II builds on the foundation provided by the first installment of the series, and at the same time, it introduces a large number of novelties and improvements. Since the enemy forces are nearly inexhaustible, players task is not to annihilate the enemy but to systematically advance to consecutive strategic objectives.

904;Alice: Madness Returns;Action;14 June 2011;A third-person action game with elements of 3D platformer and adventure game, designed by American McGee and his Spice Horse studio. Similarly to the previous work of that developer, i.e. American McGees Alice, also this game is a reinterpretation of a novel by Lewis Carroll. After ten years of dealing with catatonic schizophrenia caused by the tragic death of her parents, the eponymous heroine has a chance of getting back to a normal life. However, a hypnosis session at a psychiatrist ends up with Alice returning to Wonderland, which has greatly degenerated since the protagonists last visit. In Alice: Madness Returns you explore a string of locations, jump over platforms, avoid numerous traps, solve various logic puzzles and fight opponents using unusual weapons  such as a kitchen knife or a deck of deadly cards. The adventures are presented in high-quality audiovisuals with a unique art style  locations known from the original story were recreated in a much darker, distorted version.;Alice: Madness Returns (Part 1) This game is AWESOME;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxk_2La1Ozs;Alice  Madness Returns.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Alice  Madness Returns.jpg;alice__madness_returns_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\alice__madness_returns_screenshot\1.jpg;alice__madness_returns_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\alice__madness_returns_screenshot\2.jpg

The game's plot combines elements from two popular comic book and movie series. We can play as a Xenomorph, the Predator, or as a Marine.

After a brief affair with the French Revolution the developers decided to take players to 19th-century London of the Victorian era, giving them control of two characters: hot-headed young man named Jacob and his twin sister Evie.

935;Battalion 1944;Action;23 May 2019;A multiplayer-focused first-person shooter set during the World War 2, developed by British Bulkhead Interactive studio.

In Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines you take command of a small squad of specially trained soldiers sent on a variety of high-risk missions behind enemy lines. The game offers 25 missions with varying objectives and difficulty levels. One of the characteristic features of Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines is the fact that each member of the team has different skills. The key to success in most missions lies in using them in a smart and synchronized way. Your team is composed of a variety of commandos: a green beret, a driver, a diver, a minesweeper, a sniper, and a spy  each of them has unique skills not available for the rest.

894;Darksiders Warmastered Edition;Action;22 November 2016;A refreshed edition of Darksiders  an action-adventure game from 2010, prepared mainly with eight generation consoles in mind (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One). We assume the role of War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. As a result of a conspiracy, he initiates the end of the world prematurely, for which he is punished by being stripped of most of his powers and exiled to Earth. The protagonist decides to get revenge on the culprits, fighting hordes of demons, which are in abundance on the destroyed planet that our hero traverses in search for the perpetrators. The mainstay of the game is the dynamic combat, in which we use various types of weaponry and special attacks. The hero traverses large locations with a partially open structure, occasionally solving riddles to proceed. As the game progresses, War reclaims his lost abilities and acquires better weapons. The visual changes are the biggest asset of the Warmastered Edition. The game now runs in native 1080p, the animations are more fluid, the quality of shadows and graphical effects has been improved, while the texture resolution is now twice as high.;Darksiders Warmastered Edition Gameplay (PC HD);https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CcRur6XlEc;Darksiders Warmastered Edition.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Darksiders Warmastered Edition.jpg;darksiders_warmastered_edition_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\darksiders_warmastered_edition_screenshot\1.jpg;darksiders_warmastered_edition_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\darksiders_warmastered_edition_screenshot\2.jpg
689;Darkwood;Action;17 August 2017;A survival horror game with a top down view. Darkwood is the first commercial project of a Polish studio, Acid Wizard, and its development has been backed up by users voting on the Steam Greenlight platform. The game takes place in a procedurally generated open world, with the player placed in the role of a character trying to survive the confrontations with supernatural beings without losing his sanity in the eponymous dark wood. During a day, the protagonist must find or construct items, which will help him fend off evil entities at night. The gameplay is relatively difficult, combining features of an action game, adventure game, and a cRPG. Simple, two-dimensional visuals are dominated by semidarkness and dark shapes, and the terrifying atmosphere is further bolstered with disturbing audio.;Darkwood Official Release Gameplay Trailer;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S3tmWfFACQ;Darkwood.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Darkwood.jpg;darkwood_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\darkwood_screenshot\1.jpg;darkwood_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\darkwood_screenshot\2.jpg
591;Dauntless;RPG;26 September 2019;An online action RPG developed by Phoenix Labs studio, established by former employees of Capcom, Blizzard, Riot Games and BioWare. Dauntless takes us to Shattered Isles  a fantasy world destroyed by a mysterious cataclysm, with its continents torn apart and their fragments floating in the air. Those few who survived must face Behemoths  aggressive creatures that pose danger to all survivors, their only hope being warriors who hunt the beasts. Dauntless focuses on cooperation mode and performing quests, most of which come down to hunting monsters. Due to the fact that they possess not only brute strength but also intelligence, it is necessary to learn their behavior and weak points before engaging them. Time plays a huge role in the battles  the more we fight, the faster and more ferocious they become. Heroes can use many different weapons and combat styles, as well as special skills. Defeating opponents gets players energy, called archonite, which can be used to upgrade arsenal and armors  the bigger the monster, the bigger the benefits. Dauntless employs carton-like visuals.;DAUNTLESS Gameplay: Free to Play Monster Hunter?;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzgnHUzc294;Dauntless.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Dauntless.jpg;dauntless_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\dauntless_screenshot\1.jpg;dauntless_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\dauntless_screenshot\2.jpg

The DiRT subseries has cultivated traditions initiated in the late 1990s by the Colin McRae Rally series. After the previous game, which emphasized off-road competition, DiRT 3 constitutes a return to the original concept behind the main Colin McRae series, bringing back rally competition in its most classic form (the game uses the official WRC licenses). However, this third iteration still introduces a massive number of novelties, such as stunt arenas from the X-Games competitions, or a completely new type of contest, that is the so-called Gymkhana - it was popularized by one of the most famous drivers in the world, Ken Block. Gymkhana is all about being fast and showing off at the same time - a designated route has to be completed as quickly as possible, but the player is rewarded with points for performing various stunts along the way. As usual, a wide set of licensed cars is at the player's disposal here, many of them originating in different time periods. Also, DiRT 3 features buggies and pickups - those are typically used in off-road competitions.;Dirt 3 Reveal Trailer;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJMAUDXKjwA;DiRT 3.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\DiRT 3.jpg;dirt_3_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\dirt_3_screenshot\1.jpg;dirt_3_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\dirt_3_screenshot\2.jpg

87;Doom;Action;13 May 2016;The fourth part in one of the most famous FPS franchises in history, originated by id Software Studio in 1993. Since then, the overall story premise remained basically unchanged, having the player take on the role of a sole commando who has to fight hordes of demons from Hell spawned in a military research base as a result of a failed experiment. In contrast to the third game, which featured numerous horror elements, Doom focuses on fast-paced action, thus going back to the roots of the series. The hero learned some brand new skills, including spectacular finishers, making the gameplay even more brutal. One of the landmarks of the franchise is the considerable multiplayer mode, this time enriched with a useful tool called SnapMap. It lets players create not only maps and locations, but also their own play modes  from cooperative battles against enemy hordes to classic Deathmatches.;DOOM Eternal – Official Gameplay Reveal;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGq8Ee2gOe4;Doom.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Doom.jpg;doom_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\doom_screenshot\1.jpg;doom_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\doom_screenshot\2.jpg

Before the beginning of the game, the player first creates his character that is described by various traits and parameters. These parameters later impact the ways the player can interact with the surrounding world. The protagonists skills are supplemented by the abilities of his allies, who can be recruited during the game  they are especially helpful on the battlefield. The battles are played in real-time and the game offers an active pause. The success is determined based on the traits, skills and weapons of party members. Drakensang: The Dark Eye puts great emphasis on conversations with NPCs and on completing quests. The title features colorful graphics that are nice to watch, and a climatic soundtrack.;Let's Play - Drakensang: The Dark Eye (Completed);;Drakensang  The Dark Eye.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Drakensang  The Dark Eye.jpg;drakensang__the_dark_eye_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\drakensang__the_dark_eye_screenshot\1.jpg;drakensang__the_dark_eye_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\drakensang__the_dark_eye_screenshot\2.jpg

867;Duke Nukem Forever;Action;10 June 2011;Duke Nukem Forever is a sequel of the heavily-worshiped FPS, whose origins reach the beginning of the 1990s. After many years of silence, and a turbulent development cycle  during which the production was taken away from 3D Realms, and given to Gearbox Software  Duke Nukem Forever was released in a much more modern form. The premise of gameplay remains unchanged for the most part: gamers play as a muscled macho, who eliminates hordes of hog-like alien enemies in an spectacular manner, while saving lives of attractive females. The mechanics were enhanced with, for example, the ability to finish off enemies, drive vehicles, or use stationary weapons, environment destruction, and regenerating health (dubbed as ego) bar. The protagonist can use a slew of ridiculous guns, among which one can find the shrinker  a gun which shrinks enemies. Duke Nukem Forever is still a brutal shooter, full of raw humor, mostly expressed in the protagonists remarks, voiced by John St. John.;Duke Nukem Forever: Official HD Debut Trailer;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVuuyRGB_BA;Duke Nukem Forever.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Duke Nukem Forever.jpg;duke_nukem_forever_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\duke_nukem_forever_screenshot\1.jpg;duke_nukem_forever_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\duke_nukem_forever_screenshot\2.jpg

847;FIFA 11;Sports;28 September 2010;Another installment in the soccer game series by EA Sports. Compared to its predecessor, FIFA 11 features many improvements. One of the biggest novelties is the Personality Plus system, which reflects the player's distinct characteristics in the pitch, making the difference between soccer stars and other players more apparent.

The ones standing out are remodeled players, accurately imitating profiles and faces of their real-life counterparts. Players react properly to the situation on the pitch, argue with the referee, or scuffle with opponents.;FIFA 15 - Official E3 Gameplay Trailer;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnTYVT6lwBc;FIFA 15.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\FIFA 15.jpg;fifa_15_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\fifa_15_screenshot\1.jpg;fifa_15_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\fifa_15_screenshot\2.jpg

267;FIFA 18;Sports;29 September 2017;The game is another installment in the FIFA series. Electronic Arts introduced a lot of important changes in this follow-up, which will probably constitute a real treat for all the fans of virtual soccer. What is especially noticeable, is the introduction of the Real Players Motion technology that governs the appearances, animations and behavior of the in-game footballers. Although this technology encompasses mainly top players, the less-known footballers also behave in a more realistic manner, as the new system takes different factors into account, such as a footballer's height. The game brings a continuation to a story campaign from FIFA 17, embodied here by The Journey: Hunter Returns. FIFA 18 also brings a remodeled system of transfers in the career. The player is now capable of negotiating with clubs and particular footballers on their own. The FIFA Ultimate Team mode brings the Icon cards, representing legendary footballers. All of this is complemented by the use of the Frostbite engine, which mainly powers the cut-scenes displayed both in The Journey mode and the regular career component.;FIFA 18 GAMEPLAY TRAILER | THE WORLD'S GAME;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_7Gz_RFLnE;FIFA 18.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\FIFA 18.jpg;fifa_18_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\fifa_18_screenshot\1.jpg;fifa_18_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\fifa_18_screenshot\2.jpg

Having seized the power, we are burdened with a number of difficult decisions concerning the economy and internal affairs of the kingdom, and our actions in this part of the game will significantly impact the final result of the confrontation with the impending threat.;Fable III Gameplay (PC HD);https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO9LEGvdzvI;Fable III.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Fable III.jpg;fable_iii_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\fable_iii_screenshot\1.jpg;fable_iii_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\fable_iii_screenshot\2.jpg

440;Fallout;RPG;30 September 1997;A classic cRPG developed by Black Isle Studios. The action of Fallout is set in a post-apocalyptic world of the future. In 2077, the struggle for oil deposits between the United States and China led to an outbreak of a war, which eventually ended with both sides using their nuclear arsenal.

The player-controlled protagonist is sent to the surface with the mission to find a new water chip, necessary to secure the Vault's water supply.

604;Grand Theft Auto;Action;27 October 1997;A controversial action game developed by the Scotch studio DMA Design. The game takes place in three American cities, based on Miami, New York and San Francisco. The objective of the game is to complete various missions received from mafia bosses. At first the missions are simple (for example, stealing cars), but as players reputation increases, the objectives become more complicated and player starts participating in bank robberies, murders and other insolent crimes. The action is shown from a top-down perspective and the game gives complete freedom to the player in terms of exploring the city and preferred means of travel  both in order to complete the mission and to escape from the police. The protagonist gradually becomes more drastic, and the game very brutal. For this reason the game was banned in some countries.;Grand Theft Auto V: Official Gameplay Video;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-xHcvug3WI;Grand Theft Auto.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Grand Theft Auto.jpg;grand_theft_auto_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\grand_theft_auto_screenshot\1.jpg;grand_theft_auto_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\grand_theft_auto_screenshot\2.jpg

The core of the platformer gameplay is exploration of the open world and interacting with both encountered creatures and the planet itself, including solving logic puzzles. The items we find and the protagonists skills that are discovered in the course of the game prove to be helpful in a dangerous and constantly changing environment. Thanks to them, we can reach previously inaccessible places.

775;Homefront;Action;15 March 2011;A first-person shooter developed by KAOS Studios (Frontlines: Fuel of War). The scenario was written by John Milius, the screenwriter for Apocalypse Now. Homefront presents a vision of a near future where, after an economical crisis, the United States were suddenly attacked and eventually occupied by North Korea. The player assumes the role of a member of resistance and together with two companions he completes various missions aimed at the occupant. Various weapon types, both modern and futuristic ones, can be used against the opponents. Sequences during which the player controls vehicles such as a helicopter or a Humvee make the game more interesting. Homefront was inspired by such well-known shooters as Half-Life and Call of Duty. Similarly as those titles, it offers a linear singleplayer campaign. In addition to that, the game offers expanded multiplayer mode. Multiplayer battles take place on a greater scale than in singleplayer and vehicles are very important in them. Additionally, players can unlock new weapons and gadgets for points obtained during the game.;Homefront Walkthrough HD Episode 1: Gameplay;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKrE0GCNCiE;Homefront.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Homefront.jpg;homefront_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\homefront_screenshot\1.jpg;homefront_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\homefront_screenshot\2.jpg

631;Neverwinter Nights;RPG;18 June 2002;A role-playing game developed by BioWare (the creators of Baldur's Gate), based on the third edition of the Dungeons & Dragons system. The plot takes place in the fictional world of the Forgotten Realms and is centered on a mysterious plague sweeping the eponymous city of Neverwinter. The protagonist's task is to discover who is behind the illness and why did they start it. The story is divided into a prologue and four chapters, every one of them taking place in a different area (and you cannot return to a previously visited location). During the gameplay you do the respective missions, gather gold and items, level up your character, and, of course, fight enemies. The characters act in turns but the combat itself takes place in real time, though featuring active pause, andlike in D&Dthe results of most actions are calculated based on dice throws. The game's strong point is the multiplayer mode, which features several types of gameplay, from simple duels to complex epics.;A Thorough Look at Neverwinter Nights;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUHeWaDjuZ0;Neverwinter Nights.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Neverwinter Nights.jpg;neverwinter_nights_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\neverwinter_nights_screenshot\1.jpg;neverwinter_nights_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\neverwinter_nights_screenshot\2.jpg

855;Overlord;RPG;26 June 2007;An action game with RPG features. The title was developed by Triumph Studios. The player is taken to a classic fantasy world.

Hordes of minions with various abilities are helping them in achieving this goal. In Overlord the player is fighting legions of opponents by sending his small, brave, but very stupid followers to a certain death. They are for example very effective when it comes to triggering explosives, but if needed they can also jump into a fire or down a cliff. Although the game is filled with unique humor and a bit tongue-in-cheek, it also contains a bar that represents the corruption level of the protagonist. The player can transform the protagonist into a true evil lord. However he can also change him into a lord protector, for example by helping the citizens of a besieged city.

479;Portal 2;Action;19 April 2011;The second part of an outstanding first-person logic game from Valve Software, powered by the improved version of Source Engine, mainly known from Half-Life 2. The story starts a few hundred years after the events of the original game. Once again you play as Chell, who is awaken after having spent a long time asleep in a hibernation chamber. Trying to find her way out of Aperture laboratories, she gets stopped by an artificial intelligence that manages the compound. The AI puts the protagonist against new challenges. In order to deal with them, the heroine has to prove her knowledge of the laws of physics and make a good use of a special device able to move objects and open worm-hole portals. In the sequel, the developers gave the players much more freedom of action. This not only enriched the gameplay, but also made it much more demanding. Portal 2 features a co-op mode, offering an additional campaign with a separate storyline.;Portal 2 - Full Co-op Trailer;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A88YiZdXugA;Portal 2.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Portal 2.jpg;portal_2_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\portal_2_screenshot\1.jpg;portal_2_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\portal_2_screenshot\2.jpg
152;Postal 2;Action;14 April 2003;The direct successor to one of the most controversial PC games of all time. The original game was released in 1997. Again, the player takes on the role of Postal Dude, whose entire life collapses one day. The desperate protagonist has to fulfill a set of daily tasks over the course of one week, relieving personal tensions along the way. The game is set in Paradise - a town where the majority of population (ordinary civilians, cops, priests, zombies, mutants and even religious fanatics) is armed and hostile towards the protagonist. However, Postal Dude has a wide array of weaponry throughout the game, including both conventional firearms and melee weapons, as well as other sophisticated, often shocking means of destruction. Transition into three-dimensional environment and making the player observe the game world through the eyes of the protagonist were the largest changes introduced in the second installment. These were possible thanks to the Unreal Engine the game utilizes.;POSTAL 2 - Official Trailer (2015);https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXTIpkBDgkU;Postal 2.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Postal 2.jpg;postal_2_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\postal_2_screenshot\1.jpg;postal_2_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\postal_2_screenshot\2.jpg

The player can join either side and take part in two slightly different campaigns. In accordance with the series disgraceful tradition, nothing is stopping you from taking it out on innocent passers-by with very sophisticated tools of murder. In comparison to the previous parts of the franchise, the action is seen from the third-person perspective. During gameplay you encounter a bunch of real life figures, like the movie director Uwe Boll and the porn-star Ron Jeremy. The game is powered by the quite dated Source engine, created for Half-Life 2.;Postal 3 Postal III Walkthrough Gameplay;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi2BwG4PCMw;Postal III.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Postal III.jpg;postal_iii_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\postal_iii_screenshot\1.jpg;postal_iii_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\postal_iii_screenshot\2.jpg

633;Race Driver: GRID;Racing;30 May 2008;A racing game which is a direct continuation to the TOCA Touring Cars and TOCA Race Driver series developed by Codemasters. Contrary to the studio's other flagship franchise, DiRT, this game is focused on street and speedway races in which we sit behind the wheel of the most popular cars of the world, all of them licensed. The fun takes place in three different locations that offer us slightly different kinds of competition. With progress, we unlock new tournaments and vehicles. In the United States, we mostly race on the asphalt streets of American metropolises. In Europe, we compete primarily on speedways in such places as Donington, Silverstone, or Nurburgring. In Japan, drift is the most popular kind of races, taking place in cities and winding mountain roads. One of the titles highlight is the realistic driving model.

579;Rain World;Arcade;28 March 2017;A hybrid of a platform and a survival game. The title was developed by two people  Joar Lisberg Jakobsson was the lead programmer and the author of the idea of the game while the music was composed by James Primate. The game takes place in a hostile post-industrial realm filled with complicated machinery. The environment is constantly plagued by downpours and the animals that live in it are forced to hide from the rain in a hibernated state. The main protagonist is Slugcat  a creature that is similar to a cat. It is tasked with gathering enough food to survive the forced resting time. Whats interesting, the ecosystem is filled both with creatures smaller than Slugcat and ones that are much larger. This makes the protagonist the hunter and the prey at the same time. The gameplay concentrates on visiting atmospheric locations, avoiding confrontation with larger predators and avoiding traps and other dangers. Luckily, the unusual protagonist isnt completely defenseless  he can use a spear that allows him to kill or stun other creatures. Rain World can be played alone or in cooperation mode. Low-key colors and simple graphics fit the grim atmosphere of the game.;Rain World Gameplay [Part 1] - Slugcat - Let's Play Rain World;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Rbb-8STrg0;Rain World.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Rain World.jpg;rain_world_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\rain_world_screenshot\1.jpg;rain_world_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\rain_world_screenshot\2.jpg

393;SpellForce: The Order of Dawn;Strategy;28 November 2003;A cRPG/real-time strategy game hybrid by Phenomic. SpellForce: The Order of Dawn is set in a fantasy world, which has been almost completely destroyed by thirteen mages yearning for unlimited power. The survivors of the cataclysm they brought took refugee on many islands scattered around the world, all that was left of a once great continent, reachable only by means of magical portals. However, the peace did not last long, as the forces of evil are at work yet again. You play as a chosen one, possessing supernatural abilities, who is the only one able to neutralize the threat. You control the protagonist directly, exploring many locations and doing various quests. The character of your chosen class earns experience points and reaches higher levels, and also collects increasingly more powerful equipment. SpellForce: The Order of Dawn features a TPP view, but you can also switch to bird's eye view, in which the strategic aspect of the game becomes more apparent. You have to build bases, manage your resources and technology, and train new soldiers. You can choose from six varied races (Men, Dwarves, Elves, Dark Elves, Orcs, and Trolls), each of which has a different development path, economy and combat skills. Apart from the story campaign, the game also features a multiplayer mode.;SpellForce:The Order Of Dawn walkthrough - part 1 (Greyfell & Liannon);https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc363Y0UcM4;SpellForce  The Order of Dawn.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\SpellForce  The Order of Dawn.jpg;spellforce__the_order_of_dawn_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\spellforce__the_order_of_dawn_screenshot\1.jpg;spellforce__the_order_of_dawn_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\spellforce__the_order_of_dawn_screenshot\2.jpg
124;Spider-Man;Action;07 September 2018;An open world action-adventure game developed by Insomniac Games. The player assumes the role of the titular Spider-Man who faces the criminal underworld of New York. The gameplay is based on three pillars. The first one is exploration. The second one is completing various main and side missions. The protagonist is a superhero that can crawl and run across walls and use his web to swing on long distances. The acrobatic abilities of Spider-Man are used during Quick Time Events, special scenes with spectacular actions during which the player must press specific buttons with the right timing.

The game features stealth sequences as well  the player might sneak past enemies or eliminate them undetected. The title features high-quality graphics.

The action of the game takes place 6 years after the events shown in the previous Jedi Knight game.

This however, does not eliminate the opportunity to utilize in combat elements of more conventional arsenal, like blaster pistols and rifles.

On our adventure, we get to visit places like Tatooine or Hoth, and, simultaneously, acquire and develop numerous skills representing the light or the dark side of the Force.

128;Surviving Mars;Strategy;15 March 2018;A science fiction economic strategy game developed by Haemimont Games and published by Paradox Interactive. The title is a city builder in which the player must design the first human settlement on Mars. Being a manager of a space colony requires the player to take care of many matters - the survival and well being of the colony inhabitants depend on it. The colonists wont survive for long without access to oxygen and water, and the advanced technology of the colony requires a steady supply of energy. What makes things even harder is the fact that the systems constructed by the player can be broken by environmental conditions: the water tanks can freeze and the solar panels can be deactivated by a sandstorm. Additionally, the agency that sponsored the whole mission has specific requirements  if the player had chosen a profit-driven corporation as a sponsor, then he must remember to create a mine for valuable resources and a system that will transport these resources to Earth.

The little protagonist is able to climb, jump, and squeeze through holes between rocks, but in some cases he needs help from the griffin, who can remove larger obstacles or carry the boy into seemingly inaccessible places. The authors put much emphasis on the character's interactions with Trico and the creatures artificial intelligence, as he has his own individual character and reacts differently depending on the situation.;THE LAST GUARDIAN Gameplay Walkthrough Part 1 PS4;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgKboEkUgxo;The Last Guardian.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\The Last Guardian.jpg;the_last_guardian_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\the_last_guardian_screenshot\1.jpg;the_last_guardian_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\the_last_guardian_screenshot\2.jpg

709;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle Earth II  The Rise of the Witch-King;Strategy;28 November 2006;An official expansion for the second installment in The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle Earth series. It requires the basic version of the game to work. The Rise of the Witch-King expansion takes place between the War of the Last Alliance and the journey of the Fellowship of the Ring. This time the developers decided to be more creative and the game tells about the events that J.R.R. Tolkien described rather sparsely. The story of the expansion concentrates on the Witch-king of Angmar whose objective is to conquest the kingdoms of Arnor. The player assumes the role of the titular character and he must build power of his army and participate in the great conquests for the glory of Sauron. The gameplay in The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle Earth II: The Rise of the Witch-King doesnt differ from the one used in the basic version of the game. However, the expansion offers completely new units (including Thrall Masters and Dark Dunedains) which can be used both during the story campaign and in skirmishes and multiplayer modes. Siege engines appear on the battlefield as well. In addition to that, the races from the basic version of the game received some new units and the AI behavior was greatly improved. The process of character creation has become much clearer and more intuitive.;The Battle for Middle-Earth II: The Rise of the Witch-King Full Walkthrough HD [Hard];https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myA0zVybpQQ;The Lord of the Rings  The Battle for Middle Earth II  The Rise of the Witch-King.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\The Lord of the Rings  The Battle for Middle Earth II  The Rise of the Witch-King.jpg;the_lord_of_the_rings__the_battle_for_middle_earth_ii__the_rise_of_the_witch-king_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\the_lord_of_the_rings__the_battle_for_middle_earth_ii__the_rise_of_the_witch-king_screenshot\1.jpg;the_lord_of_the_rings__the_battle_for_middle_earth_ii__the_rise_of_the_witch-king_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\the_lord_of_the_rings__the_battle_for_middle_earth_ii__the_rise_of_the_witch-king_screenshot\2.jpg

In Saboteur the player assumes the role of an Irish man named Sean who begins a guerilla war against the occupant.

The world of Saboteur is large and open and in the virtual Paris the player can find many characteristic buildings, including the Eiffel Tower.;The Saboteur (PC 60FPS) | Full Gameplay/Playthrough | No Commentary;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O82BTJpmkiQ;The Saboteur.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\The Saboteur.jpg;the_saboteur_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\the_saboteur_screenshot\1.jpg;the_saboteur_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\the_saboteur_screenshot\2.jpg

644;Tomb Raider: Underworld;Action;18 November 2008;Developed once again by Crystal Dynamics, another installment of the third-person perspective adventure series started in 1996. Tomb Raider: Underworld is a continuation of the events from previous parts of the series and concentrates on the search for artifacts connected with the Nordic god Thor. On her journey, Lara Croft visits new locations, like Thailand and south Mexico, and dives in the Mediterranean Sea and the Arctic Ocean.

The games mechanics remain mostly unchanged, but the gameplay has become more non-linear. Lara has a new set of tricks and a useful gadget  a rope with a grappling hook.

669;Torchlight;RPG;27 October 2009;A very well-made hack-and-slash game, created by a small studio Runic Games, whose members contributed to such productions as Hellgate London, Mythos or the Diablo franchise. The story begins in the eponymous village of Torchlight, under which large deposits of a magical ore called ember have been discovered. However, the sudden mining boom resulted in another discovery, this time of a great evil lurking underground. This is where the protagonist steps in. You choose from three character classes: Alchemist, Destroyer and Vanquisher. Every class has branched development options and a unique fighting style. The character is accompanied by an animal follower, which helps you with fighting and can carry your items. Like a proper RPG, Torchlight features dynamic real-time combat utilizing the isometric view. The defeated foes drop large quantities of money and useful items, which can be equipped by the protagonist. The visuals are similar to those of Diablo III, although they are slightly more sugary.;Torchlight Gameplay (PC HD) [1080p60FPS];https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUPLGFaslC0;Torchlight.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Torchlight.jpg;torchlight_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\torchlight_screenshot\1.jpg;torchlight_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\torchlight_screenshot\2.jpg
283;Torchlight II;RPG;20 September 2012;A sequel to the fantasy hack'n'slash game by Runic Games, founded by the creators of the cult game Diablo. The story takes place several years after the events of the first installment.

Playing as one of the four available character classes, you have to stop the mad Alchemist and prevent disturbing the balance of good and evil. Compared to the previous installment, Torchlight II features a bigger, open world with diverse environments, changing weather, and a day-and-night cycle. Other elements include randomly generated quests, treasures, and enemies. The biggest innovation is the introduction of the multiplayer mode, enabling you to co-operate with other players, with the use of either the local network or the internet. What's left unchanged are the characteristic fairytale-esque visuals of the game.;Torchlight 2: Act 1 - Part 1 (Gameplay);https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWSWgzemqgU;Torchlight II.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Torchlight II.jpg;torchlight_ii_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\torchlight_ii_screenshot\1.jpg;torchlight_ii_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\torchlight_ii_screenshot\2.jpg
161;Torment: Tides of Numenera;RPG;28 February 2017;A computer RPG based on a tabletop roleplaying system called Numenera that combines elements of fantasy and science-fiction. The title was created by indie developer inXile entertainment, mostly known for the highly acclaimed remake of The Bards Tale and post-apocalyptic Wasteland 2. The game is a spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment - one of the classics of the genre, created by Black Isle Studio in 1999. The original games co-creator, Colin McComb, was the lead designer in this new project. The game is set in the distant future, where humanity created a society on a civilization level similar to the Middle Ages, albeit the setting features also rare examples of highly-advanced technology left after more advanced, extinct civilizations. Gameplay is based on the rules of the tabletop system, appropriately modified for the needs of a computer game. The game features isometric perspective and real-time action, although the battles themselves are turn-based, as well as a system of moral choices, which have impact on the world and reactions of non-player characters.;Torment: Tides of Numenara - 6 Minutes of Tactical Combat;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JymPWyFk1pA;Torment  Tides of Numenera.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Torment  Tides of Numenera.jpg;torment__tides_of_numenera_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\torment__tides_of_numenera_screenshot\1.jpg;torment__tides_of_numenera_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\torment__tides_of_numenera_screenshot\2.jpg
530;Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia;Strategy;03 May 2018;A spin-off to the Total War series, in which the developer studio Creative Assembly takes the players to the British Isles from the 9th century. Our task is to join a side in the war for domination over the Isles. When working on this game, the developers drew their inspirations from the previous Total War titles, thus, the game is a combination of a turn-based strategy and an RTS game.;THE LAST KINGDOM! - Wessex Campaign - Total War Saga: Thrones Of Britannia Gameplay #1;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcnoo0PZ1cA;Total War Saga  Thrones of Britannia.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Total War Saga  Thrones of Britannia.jpg;total_war_saga__thrones_of_britannia_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\total_war_saga__thrones_of_britannia_screenshot\1.jpg;total_war_saga__thrones_of_britannia_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\total_war_saga__thrones_of_britannia_screenshot\2.jpg
225;Total War: Attila;Strategy;17 February 2015;Another chapter in the Total War large-scale strategy game series, created and developed by the Creative Assembly studio. After a couple of sequels to the earlier installments in the series (e.g. Medieval, Shogun, and Rome), the developers took on a new great historical figure. The game is set in the late 4th and the early 5th century CE. The Roman Empire is on the brink of collapse, at war with numerous barbaric tribes of the Huns and the Visigoths. Playing as Rome, you lead an army weakened by continuous skirmishes. This makes gameplay much more demanding, challenging even for the veterans of the series. The game realistically presents various military, social, and religious tendencies of the period, e.g. you have to counteract diseases and epidemics and deal with climate changes that affect farming and economy. Additionally, both the UI and the game engine were improved, resulting in better visual quality.;Total War: Attila Gameplay With Developer Commentary;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWya9q6RhyI;Total War  Attila.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Total War  Attila.jpg;total_war__attila_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\total_war__attila_screenshot\1.jpg;total_war__attila_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\total_war__attila_screenshot\2.jpg
123;Total War: Rome II;Strategy;03 September 2013;A grand-scale strategy game developed by British studio Creative Assembly.

The games highlight are the spectacular battles of armies fielding thousands of units. The developers of Total War: Rome II carefully kept to historical truth when it comes to battle formations, weaponry, and tactics.

206;Total War: Warhammer;Strategy;24 May 2016;Next installment in the epic strategy game series, introduced by Creative Assembly in 2000. After a series of titles set in different historical periods, the developers decided to take players into one of the most famous fantasy universes, created by the Games Workshop company. In the dark universe of Warhammer, different races constantly fight for power and world domination, unaware of the fact that the real threat comes from a mighty force from the north. The game lets become the leader of one of several races, including humans, orcs, goblins, dwarves, vampires, and others. Disregarding the fantasy elements, the gameplay does not differ significantly from the previous games in the series, with epic real-time battles lying at its core. Between the battles the gameplay switches to a turn-based mode, where on a world map you develop your country, its economy, and establish diplomatic relations with other nations.;Total War: Warhammer - First Gameplay - 10 minutes - 1080p;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4siz1KrnO0;Total War  Warhammer.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Total War  Warhammer.jpg;total_war__warhammer_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\total_war__warhammer_screenshot\1.jpg;total_war__warhammer_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\total_war__warhammer_screenshot\2.jpg
200;Total War: Warhammer II;Strategy;28 September 2017;Another installment in a popular series of strategy games created by Creative Assembly. Unlike the first part of the subseries, which was set in the Old World, this time the players travel to the west, where they wage a war across four continents: Ulthuan, Naggaroth, Southern Realms, and Lustria. Four races take part in the conflict, i.e. the High Elves, the Dark Elves, the Lizardmen, and the Skaven. Each of these factions fights for control over the Great Vortex, which they can heal or disperse using various rituals. Once more, gameplay in Total War: Warhammer II is based on two pillars. In a strategy map view you move your armies, manage economy and expand cities (all this in turns), while battles are waged in real time on 3D battlefields. Each race has its unique mechanics, units and heroes. Besides, owners of the first and second game can download a huge map that combines both game worlds.

The game refers to the initial two-dimensional installments of the series, which means that battles are presented from the classical side view. The title does not lack for several enriching novelties, though. These include the possibility to hide inside buildings and to use vehicles that allow us to traverse the battlefield and deal damage to the enemy. Visually, the production features the characteristic cartoonish visual style, although the worms appearance and animation were refreshed.;8 Minutes of Worms W.M.D. Gameplay;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4oBUqGeok;Worms W.M.D.jpg;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\Photos\Worms W.M.D.jpg;worms_w.m.d_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\worms_w.m.d_screenshot\1.jpg;worms_w.m.d_screenshot;C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\GamersHub\gamesFromCSV\images\worms_w.m.d_screenshot\2.jpg

413;Wreckfest;Racing;14 June 2018;A dynamic racing game developed by the creators of the cult FlatOut series and the last two iterations of the almost equally famous Ridge Racer series  Finnish studio Bugbear Entertainment. The game takes inspiration from the previous works of the studio, focusing on crazy rivalry, unrestrained with fair play rules.

Therefore, the races overflow with vicious competition, and the tracks quickly become covered with car wrecks of the defeated. The game features complex car customization both in terms of appearance and performance. From the technical side, the game catches the eye with well-polished graphics and advanced damage system, which impacts not only how the cars look but also how they behave.
